  <h1>Welcome to My HTML-Only Project</h1>
  <p>
    Hi, and thanks for visiting my site! This is my first project using only HTML with no CSS, no JavaScript, just the basics. I wanted to see what I could build with the core language of the web and really understand how HTML works on its own.
  </p>
  <p>
    I find it interesting how much you can do with just HTML. Even without any styling, you can organize content, add images, audio, and video, and make your site accessible to everyone. Working with only HTML has helped me focus on structure and meaning, instead of getting distracted by design details.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here’s an example image I added to make the page more inviting. I think images are a great way to break up text and make things feel more personal.

    I also learned how easy it is to include audio and video directly in HTML5. Here’s a short audio clip you can play:
  </p>
  <audio controls>
    <source src="https://www.soundhelix.com/examples/mp3/SoundHelix-Song-1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
  </audio>
  <p>
    And here’s a sample video, just to show how multimedia works in plain HTML:
  </p>
  <video width="400" controls>
    <source src="https://www.w3schools.com/html/mov_bbb.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
  </video>
  <p>
    Building this site has helped me understand how important it is to get the basics right. If you can make a page work well with just HTML, it’s much easier to add style and interactivity later. I hope this project shows that even the simplest tools can be powerful if you use them thoughtfully.

    Thanks for checking out my project! Feel free to explore the other pages to see more about me and what I’ve learned.
